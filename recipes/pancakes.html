        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These are pancakes. I'm pretty sure everyone knows what they are so I'm not going to bother explaining.</p>
        <p>This is your average pancake recipe so it's easy to follow and recreate!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/3 cup wheat germ</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>5 and 1/3 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 and 1/2 cups of buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 beaten eggs</li>
            <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <li>n a food processor or in a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour,
             white flour, wheat germ or oats, baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, and salt.</li>
        <li>Cut the butter into small pieces with a knife, and add the butter to the flour-mixture. 
            Mix until the mixture has a sand-like consistency.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the center of the flour-butter mixture, and add the buttermilk and eggs. 
            Stir until the liquids are fully incorporated.</li>
        <li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat and grease the surface with 1 tablespoon of butter or oil. 
            Ladle the batter onto the surface to form 4 inch pancakes. Once bubbles form on the top of the pancakes, 
            flip them over, and cook them on the other side for about 2 minutes.</li>
