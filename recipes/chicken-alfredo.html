        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a creamy pasta that's very easy to make through a sauce that can be bought at any store.</p>
        <p>You can incorporate many things on it but people usually put chicken or mushrooms on this recipe.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 lb skinless, boneless chicken breasts cut into chunks</li>
            <li>Salt and ground pepper for taste</li>
            <li>2 packages of thin spaghetti</li>
            <li>4 jars of Alfredo sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>2 tbsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chopped onion</li>
            <li>2 tbsp fresh chopped basil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp onion powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1.5 cups shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Head a large skillet over medium-high heat.

            <li>Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook thin spaghetti in the boiling water stirring occasionally
                until tender yet firm to the bite, 8-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add Alfredo sauce to the chicken along with the Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion, basil, salt, black pepper,
                onion powder, and cayenne. Bring to a slight boil; stir in Parmesan cheese. Cook mixture until cheese is melted and 
                your are able to lift a spoon out of the sauce without getting cheese hanging onto it 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. 
                Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Add broccoli to sauce.</li>
            <li>Drain cooked pasta. Scoop into individual serving bowls and pour sauce on top.</li>
